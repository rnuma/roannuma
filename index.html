            <hr></hr>
           
        <p>Hi there! My name is Roan and I graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.
            Ever since I was a young age, I've always been fascinated with technology and understanding how it impacts our everyday lives. 
            I now aspire to land a Software Engineering role that will enable me to innovate and design consumer technology for millions of 
            people around the world! My career interests are in cybersecurity, machine learning and embedded systems. Some of my personal 
            hobbies and interests include: playing basketball, listening to music, gaming and reading sports articles!

        of future engineers. In Spring 2021, CoE ambassadors were assigned mini-projects in teams due to the cancellation of in-person gatherings 
        (Covid-19). Our team was responsible for designing a university-sponsored website intended for 2,500+ First-Year Engineering (FYE) students. 
        The website will guide FYE students into selecting 1 of 17 engineering major disciplines. This project is ongoing!

        chapter programs and events. I was also in charge of coordinating 20+ company events and info sessions to connect members to various industry opportunities
        throughout the year. Prior to my role as Corporate Relations Chair, I served as the Telecommunications Chair for 2 years and was part of the Communications Zone.

            cooperated with Executive Board members within the Communications Zone and Membership Zone. We were designing ways to better communicate with members 
            and keep members virtually active, to ensure that members were receiving the best Purdue NSBE experience possible despite the ongoing challenges with 
            COVID-19. I was also part of the NSBE Mentorship program and mentored both an ECE and CS undergraduate student. I provided both students with academic/professional 
            guidance to help them blossom during their undergraduate career here at Purdue.

    <p> In October of 2020, I participated in a 3-day virtual summit alongside 120+ students
        in various tech-related majors all across the United States. I had the unique opportunity to network with 
        recruiters, engineers and executives from companies like Google, Lyft, Salesforce, Adobe, Two Sigma, and more. The 
        summit was filled with workshops and panel events where I learned proper networking & interviewing skills and gained
        insight on navigating careers within Software Engineering. The summit also included an exclusive career fair where I was able 
        to showcase my skills, passions and experiences to recruiters. I had an overall great experience and have grown so much 
        professionally from this opportunity!

    <p> During my freshman year, I was a part of the NSBE Grand Prix Team. In a team of 7 engineers, 
        we revamped the NSBE go-kart from last year and focused on improving its technical features. 
        I was able to work mainly on the back wheels and axles, sprocket chain and engine mount 
        components of the go-kart. As a team, we competed at Whiteland Raceway Park in Indiana for 
        a fall racing competition and used that racing experience to prepare for the Purdue Grand 
        Prix in the Spring. Unfortunately, the Purdue Grand Prix was cancelled due to COVID-19.
