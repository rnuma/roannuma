          I decided to put the web development skills I learned this summer to the test and created my own personal website 
          from scratch! I used HTML for the website‚Äôs pictures and information, CSS for the color and design, and JavaScript 
          for the background pictures. I also used Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks to help with styling, layout and website 
          responsiveness. My goal for this project was to showcase my education, skills, projects and experiences in a creative 
          manner, and go more in depth with my projects and experiences. Now that I have my own personal website, I‚Äôll continue 
          to add more experiences as I progress through my college career!

            For one of my personal projects this summer, I created a program using C++ that tracks a Purdue undergraduate student‚Äôs 
            progress in a particular major by allowing the user to store their progress each semester into a binary file to view, modify or 
            delete. My goal for this project was to make an alternative and easier method for students to track their progress towards a 
            college degree, rather than requesting transcripts every semester or using the Purdue GPA calculator to predict their grades.
        </p>

        </p> The program will ask the user for: name, PUID (college ID), classification, college (within Purdue), major, semester number, 
        basic information for each class (name, number of credit hours, letter grade), total number of credit hours from past semesters, 
        and total number of quality points from past semesters.
        <p>

        <p>The program includes a GPA calculator that will calculate the user‚Äôs semester GPA and cumulative GPA based on their input for 
          letter grades, credit hours and quality points. In order for the user to access, modify or delete their college record, they‚Äôll 
          have to enter in their unique PUID number in order to access their file.

    <p class = "feature-title text-black span" >This summer I decided to learn web development in order to create and design websites from scratch. 
      Because of the ongoing information about COVID-19 and the amount of misinformation there is online and on social media about the virus, I decided to 
      build a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to provide factual information about COVID-19 that I believe everyone should know. I also used
      Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks to improve the overall design and interactivity of the website as well. 
    </p>

    </p> The website I made is easy to navigate, answers common questions surrounding COVID-19, and contains links to important resources 
    for viewers. I even provided my own personal advice and links to the credible sources I used for the information presented on the website. 
    My goal for this project was to provide people with accurate information about COVID-19 to help stop the spread of misinformation and potentially 
    save someone‚Äôs life.

  <p class = "feature-title text-black span" >This summer, I participated in a 24-hour hackathon called SigmaHacks 2.0. I was able to team up 
    with 3 other hackers to create a full stack web application that enables front-line workers to search for and purchase nearby housing rentals 
    amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Our platform also allows for landlords to post housing rentals for front-line workers to occupy. 
  </p>

  <p>To build this project, we used Python for the backend, Django for the web framework, HTML and CSS for the frontend and SQLite for the database. 
    I focused mainly on the frontend development and created an interactive chatbot feature to help users check for COVID-19 related symptoms and determine 
    if they need to seek medical care immediately. 
  </p>


  </p>The goal for our project was to help front-line workers find a place to temporarily stay in order to keep their families and community safe 
  from being exposed to COVID-19. We also wanted to create incentives for landlords to have consistent renters due to the growing marketplace and the 
  steady demand for temporary housing despite the global pandemic. A fun fact about our project is that our project name, ‚ÄúSoteria‚Äù, is the name of the 
  goddess of safety in Greek mythology!

  <p class = "feature-title text-black span" >Throughout my freshman year here at Purdue University, I was part of the Purdue EPICS 
    (Engineering Projects in Service) program. I teamed up with VETS (Technology Assisting Veterans), a team that focuses on developing 
    mobile impairment technologies for veterans in the surrounding community. Within VETS I was a part of two sub-teams, Operation Row and 
    Operation Swim, where we helped design a prosthetic arm device for a veteran named Jared Bullock and a floatation and entry & egress device 
    for a 12 year-old boy named Charlie. Jared was wounded during a mission and lost his right limb, which affected his gym training. 
    Our prosthetic arm device would connect Jared to a seated row machine and allow him to perform a rowing exercise safely and properly. 
    Charlie has a condition known as cerebral palsy which makes it hard for him to have fun in the pool. So our team 
    partnered with the Grant House Foundation in West Lafayette, Indiana to help create a floatation device (similar to a life jacket) that 
    would provide Charlie the support he needs to enjoy his time safely in the pool.

        <div class="card card-body">

          <p>For Operation Row, I helped with the outer design of the arm socket device by smoothing out the edges with sanding tools and cutting out 
            the socket holes using the dremel tool. I also assisted with the evaluation and research of our design methods and helped eliminate the design 
            flaws of the vest that would attach to Jared and connect with the socket device. For Operation Swim, I contributed to the preliminary design of 
            the ADA regulated entry & egress device and focused on the failure analysis of the design and effects of device failure by using severity guidelines 
            and ratings to evaluate the efficiency of the device.

            <p> </p>

            <p>In addition my to personal contributions, I also served as the Webmaster / Communications Coordinator for the VETS team. I reconstructed and managed our 
              team‚Äôs website, shared team and project updates with the EPICS community via Twitter, and was in charge of the team-recruiting efforts by creating physical 
              and virtual recruitment team flyers for prospective EPICS students. 
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I took away so much from being a part of VETS in my freshman year. I learned how to properly collaborate and communicate within a team and understood how engineers 
              work towards designing solutions to specific problems that involve connecting an individual to a specific product. Thanks my experience with VETS, I am more 
              confident when it comes working within an engineering team and following a design process towards an efficient solution.

    ENGR 133 (Transforming Ideas To Innovation) focused on introducing students to Python and MATLAB programming. For the final 
    course project of the year, I built a calculator using Python to calculate the course grade, letter grade and pass/fail grade 
    of any student in ENGR 133.

  </p>

  </p> This was my first time building a project using Python. I was able to incorporate what I learned throughout the semester into 
  making my project. I used loops, if-else statements, and a user input function within my program to carry out the calculations and 
  display the student‚Äôs data. My goal for this project was to make it easier for students to calculate or predict their final grade in 
  ENGR 133 since we were nearing the end of the semester.
